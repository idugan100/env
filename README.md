# golang env file parsing package
I created this package to handle all my env file parsing on my go projects.

This package can be installed with ```go get github.com/idugan100/env```

You can use the ```go doc``` command to see the documentation for this package. You can learn more about this [here](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/doc).
