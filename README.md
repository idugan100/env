[![Tests/Linting/Formatting](https://github.com/idugan100/env/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/idugan100/env/actions/workflows/main.yml)

I created this package to handle all my env file parsing on my go projects.

This package can be installed with ```go get github.com/idugan100/env```

You can see the documentation for this package [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/idugan100/env).
